Journey Daemon
--------------

Daemon is a simple event-loop daemon written in PHP. Although its not nearly as full featured as many other event-loop projects ([looking at you react](https://github.com/reactphp/event-loop)), it is incredibly small and light weight, and easily delegates its own operation to external objects.

Use composer to install it and load it.
